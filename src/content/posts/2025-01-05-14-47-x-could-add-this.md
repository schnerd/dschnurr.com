To their credit, they do have an [optional ID verification flow](https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/verification-policy), but it requires uploading an image of your ID, which is then shared with 3rd party verification services (Au10tix / Stripe), with some PII retained.

In some cases this might be required by law, but for simply preventing spam accounts it's likely overkill.

Using zero-knowledge proofs, you could tap your phone on your passport to provide X with a cryptographic proof that you are a citizen of some country, without revealing your real identity.

Projects like [@openpassportapp](https://x.com/openpassportapp) demonstrate that this is possible. And if we're lucky, operating systems will make these sorts of privacy-preserving identity primitives available to app developers out of the box.
