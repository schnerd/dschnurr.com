> Responding to post from [@gdb](https://x.com/gdb): When starting OpenAI, we thought hard about what job titles to use—didn't want to bucket people into researchers & engineers. Alan Kay advised that they used "Member of Technical Staff" at Xerox Parc, we loved & adopted it...

Small but important decision that has had a very positive impact on company culture in my opinion—it attracts people who are motivated by the mission rather than those chasing titles & status.
