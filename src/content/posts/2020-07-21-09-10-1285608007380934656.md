Excited to share that I’ve joined OpenAI! I’ll be working on building out the new GPT-3 API and other projects that help communicate and apply new research.

These technologies have so much positive potential, but also present many new challenges and potential for misuse. I feel a deep responsibility to help ensure they are rolled out as safely and equitably as possible.
