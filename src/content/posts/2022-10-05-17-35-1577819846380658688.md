> Responding to post from [@GoogleDeepMind](https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind): Today in @Nature: #AlphaTensor, an AI system for discovering novel, efficient, and exact algorithms for matrix multiplication - a building block of modern computations. AlphaTensor finds faster algorithms for many matrix sizes: [dpmd.ai/dm-alpha-tensor](dpmd.ai/dm-alpha-tensor) & [dpmd.ai/nature-alpha-tensorâ€¦](dpmd.ai/nature-alpha-tensor)

Using AI to make faster AI algorithms.

Super impressive research. Also feels like the strongest evidence so far that intelligence explosion is a real possibility.
